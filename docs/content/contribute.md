This tool is still in its early stages. I am working on adding more features and fixing bugs. I am also working on adding more tests to ensure that the tool is reliable.

If you find any issues, please report them to me. I will do my best to fix them as soon as possible.

I look forward to hearing your feedback. Feel free to fire feature request or bug issue if you want and necessary: [Issues](https://github.com/davelet/git-intelligence-message/issues/new).

Thank you for your interest in this project.
