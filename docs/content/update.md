# Update

Check for updates and install the latest version:

```bash
gim update
```

Force update even if you're on the latest version:

```bash
gim update --force
```

Set the max number of tries to check for updates (5 if not set):

```bash
gim update --max 3
```

Set the interval days between each update check (30 if not set):

```bash
gim update --interval 7
```

You don't need to check update manually. The application will check for updates by itself every time you run it.
